What is this verse describing?: One of Davidâ€™s mighty men, commander of the 11th rotational army division; a Pirathonite of the tribe of Ephraim.

Why is that interesting?: Althought the Bible doesn't say much about this faithful warrior. He attained a prominent possition in David's army. He was one of the 30 Headsmen, and the commander of the 11th Division. He no doubt was a courageous mighty warrier who supported his King and Jehovah his God.

What lesson can I learn from this?: Do I do all I can to reach out in the modern day army of witnesses? Am I willing to become a leader and courageously set an example of faith and obedience?

What does this teach me about Jehovah?: Jehovah had this man mentioned in the Bible as a faithful example, we don't know much about him or what he did. But we know that he worked hard as a commander for Jehovah's anointed King, and Jehovah showed he was greatful by having his name recorded in the Bible for us.

What goal should I set based on this lesson?: Pray to Jehovah that I may be more like Benaiah, willing to take responsability and take the lead in the congregation.
